The device is capable of picking up fine particles in the air, and it also detects other potentially toxic harmful substances.

Data on air pollution have raised concerns about the potential health effects of even smaller particles, the so-called nanoparticles, which are particles produced through a controlled engineering process and ultra-fine particles. Some nanoparticles and ultrafine particles can induce oxidative stress, airway inflammation and toxicity in animal models and have been associated with increased respiratory symptoms in patients with asthma. Air pollution particulate is a complex mixture, derived from the combustion of fossil fuels (especially diesel). The particles can have local and systemic inflammatory effects, suggesting an explanation for their impact on both lung and cardiovascular health. The so-called PM 2.5 (particulate material with a diameter <2.5 Î¼m) is able to produce a greater inflammatory response than larger particles. Data indicate that particulate air pollution increases death rates among all causes, particularly for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
